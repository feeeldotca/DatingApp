# DatingApp -- A practical example of how to build an application with ASP.NET Core API and Angular from start to finish

Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/

* Learn how to build a web application from start to publishing using ASPNET Core (v2.1), Entity Framework Core and Angular (v6)
* Students who complete this course will have a practical understanding of Angular and ASPNET Core
* Understand how to structure an Angular application using best practices
* Learn how to integrate 3rd party components into the Angular application

This course gives a good overview of a full-stack application. It touches everything you need to begin developing your own applications. A great plus on this course is the project we are building throughout the course. Even though I loved this course, I don't feel like I am now ready to implement these concepts on my own. For that, I would need an additional .NET-specific course. All said, great course, a nice voice to listen to, and had a good impression on .NET core with Angular!
